# Wyoming GIS project

<br>

## What are the aims of this project?

This project is to practice GIS and mapping techniques that I have been learning recently using QGIS.

<br>

## What is included in the project?

Using open source data for the State of Wyoming I created a business case to explore future power production within the area, concentrating on oil and renewable wind power generation.

<br>

## What technologies have I used to create my analysis?

This project was created solely in QGIS 3.14 using open source information.  In order to answer the business questions that I had set myself I imported a variety of .shp files, raster images and a .csv file of rainfall figures all to create a multitude of layers to work with and manipulate to create a variety of final product images and maps.   

<br>

In order to answer some of the questions I had to use a variety of geoprocessing tools such as buffer, difference, intersection and union.  Here I am creating 50Km buffer zones from all main roads to satisfy a requirement for any future oil extraction sites.

Here I am creating layers of protected and conservation areas where no future power development will allowed.

Using the layouts functions within QGIS I created the final images and maps that can be found in the analysis .pdf document.

The analysis can be found in the wyoming_power.pdf document and higher resolution images and maps can be found in the **"project_images"** folder.
